              Accessibility in HTML with Examples & Best Practices

            <h2 class="sub-title">Purpose</h2>
            <p class="plain-text mb-0">
              Web accessibility is guided by four key principles:
              <strong>
                Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.</strong
              >
              These principles ensure that all users, regardless of their
              abilities or disabilities, can access and interact with online
              content effectively. The purpose of the document "Accessibility in
              HTML with Examples and Best Practices" is to guide developers and
              content creators in designing accessible HTML components. It
              provides practical examples and best practices to ensure digital
              content is usable by everyone.

            <p class="plain-text">
              Web accessibility compliance involves adhering to legal standards
              and guidelines that ensure digital content is accessible to all
              users, including those with disabilities. Laws like the Section
              508 mandate specific accessibility criteria, while the Web Content
              Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) outline best practices for
              creating accessible content. Compliance helps organizations avoid
              legal issues and fosters inclusivity, enhancing the user
              experience for a diverse audience.
