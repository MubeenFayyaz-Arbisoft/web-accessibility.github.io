        <h3>Caption Prerecorded Explanation</h3>
        <p class="plain-text">
        Specifically, this criterion focuses on ensuring that captions are provided for prerecorded video content,
        allowing people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or those who prefer to watch content without sound,
        to fully understand the media.This applies to prerecorded video content, not live video.
        For example, a prerecorded TV show, a YouTube video, or any video hosted on a website.
        <br>
        <b>What to look for in Prerecorded Captions:</b>
        <br>
        - The multimedia provides accurate captions for the audio content.
        - Be synchronized with the video (i.e., they appear on the screen at the same time as the audio).
        <br>
        - Captions are provided for all multimedia content.
        <br>
        - Captions are accurate and include all dialogue and equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand
         the program content such as spoken words (dialogue), including sound effects, e.g., music, laughter, speaker identification and location.
         Speaker identification (if multiple people are speaking)
         <br>
        - All other relevant information in the video is clearly visible (not obstructed by captions) when captions are enabled.
        - Be readable (i.e., have sufficient contrast, easy-to-read fonts, etc.).
        <br>
        <b>Accessible to All:</b> The goal is to ensure that all users, especially those who cannot hear or have limited hearing,
        can still understand the content being conveyed by the video. This includes people in environments where they cannot
        turn up the sound, as well as those with hearing impairments.
        <br>
        <b>How to Test:</b>
        <br>
        In the media video look for CC in the media controls
        - Enable CC icon so that subsitles show on the screen.
        - Some video provided multiple language subtitle options as well, on clicking the cc option you will be provided by a list
        of languages to select from. This further helps the user to view/read in the language they are most comfortable to understand.
        (Default is usually in english language.)
        Example: If a website has a video of a lecture, the video should have captions that display the professorâ€™s spoken words as well
        as any other important sound elements, such as sound effects or music, to fully represent the media experience.
