        <h3>Caption Live Explanation</h3>
          <p class="plain-text">
            Captions for live content are an essential component to ensure accessibility for users who
            are deaf or hard of hearing. As of WCAG 2.2, which builds on the previous WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 guidelines,
            Level AA refers to standards that are considered essential for accessibility but not absolutely critical
            for basic functionality.
            <br>
            The live multimedia provides accurate captions for the audio content.
            Eg: When speaker audio is showing up in live captions, while he speaks.
            <br>
            It is important that when live events are broadcasted such as a presidential speech,
            a sport commentary or an important event speech, the information perceived by the audience should be
            viable to all regardless of their disability.
            <br>
            Live captions make content accessible for a wide range of audiences, including:
            <br>
            <b>Deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals:</b> Who rely on captions to follow spoken content.
            <br>
            <b>Non-native speakers:</b> Who may find it easier to understand written text than audio.
            <br>
            <b>Anyone in noisy or sound-sensitive environments:</b> Where they may not be able to hear the audio clearly.
            (E.g: you are on a busy bus and need to listen to the speech, it is difficult to hear it with all the
            background noise, this case is ideal to read through the live caption so that the information provided
            is easily perceived by the audience.)
            <br>
            <b>What to look for in Live Captions:</b>
            <br>
            <b>Real-time updates:</b> Captions should appear quickly (within a couple of seconds) after the speaker talks.
            <br>
            <b>Accurate text:</b> The captions should reflect the spoken words accurately, including sound effects
            or important contextual audio cues (like "applause" or "music").
            <br>
            <b>Legibility:</b> Text should be large enough to be read easily and should not overlap with
            other visual elements on the screen.
            <br>
            <b>How to Test:</b>
            Search for a live event on platforms like YouTube Live, Twitch, or Facebook Live,
            and see if the "CC" (closed captions) option is available and working in real-time.
